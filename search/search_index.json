Artwork is taken here in the sense of a movable, physical work of some sort such as would be typically inventoried by a museum. Specific documentation of elements of an artwork depend highly upon the kind of artwork it is. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an artwork and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project. These were: Acronym Source Name Official Access Point Schema Documentation Maintained by CDWA Categories for the Description of Works of Art http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/definitions.html Getty DC Dublinc Core http://dublincore.org/ http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ ASIS CCO Cataloging Cultural Objects http://cco.vrafoundation.org/index.php/ http://cco.vrafoundation.org/index.php/toolkit/cco_pdf_version/ CCO Commons VRA Core Visual Resources Association core categories http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/VRA_Core4_Element_Description.pdf Visual Resources Association Model Sections Description The fields used to describe an artwork can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category. The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to an artwork, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a work by known authors/sources. 3 Part/Whole This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between an artwork and its parts. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the creation and destruction of an artwork. 5 Actor Relations This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant relations between the artwork and known actors. Primary of such relations are those of creator to the work. 6 Substance This category gathers together descriptors used for stating the physical constitutional features of the documented artwork. 7 Representation This category gathers together descriptors regarding the representational level recognised to be present in the documented artwork. 8 Events This category gathers together information about significant documented events that an artwork may go through. 9 Location This category gathers together information regarding the present location of a documented artwork. 10 Rights This category gathers together information regarding the rights claims on a documented artwork. 11 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to an artwork. An overview of all the groups of the entity described here is available in the image below. Click to enlarge it. Names and Classifications The attribution of names and types to artwork, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating artworks lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Likewise, additional classifiers of the artwork, such as how it is has been classified as an object as such, give important distinguishing characteristics. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" ID Attribution Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented instance of artwork. ->P1->E42[1] ID Attribution Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented person. ->P1->E42[1]->P2->E55[\"Identifier Type\"] ID Attribution Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the institution providing the artwork it's ID. ->P1->E42[1]->P37i->E15->P14->E39 n/a Title This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented artwork. ->P1->E41 n/a Type This field is used to indicate the formal type of object an artwork is. ->P2->E55[3] ->P2->E55[3]->P71->E32 Alternate Title Alternative Title This field is used to indicate additional names under which the documented artwork is known. This can be linked to the additional name type and earliest and latest date of use of that name. ->P1->E41[4] Alternate Title Alternate Title Type This field is used to indicate the type of alternate name that is attributed to the documented artwork. ->P1->E41[4]->P2->E55 Alternate Title Alternate Title Use Period - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest known date for use of this name for the documented artwork. ->P1->E41[4]->R64i->F52[5]->p4->E52[6]->P82a->XSD:Date Alternate Title Alternate Title Use Period - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest known date for use of this name for the documented artwork. ->P1->E41[4]->R64i->F52[5]->p4->E52[6]->P82b->XSD:Date n/a Alternative Title - Used by This field is used to indicate the actor by whom the title attributed to the artwork is/was used. ->R63i->F52[5]->P14->E39 n/a Style - Movement This field is used to associate the documented artwork to a group of actors that collectively form an artistic movement. ->P140i->E13[8]->P141->E74 ->P140i->E13[8]->P2->\"p15 is influenced by\" The model provides means for tracking identifiers, present and past name use, titles and well known artwork classifiers. Description Artworks are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to the aesthetic and historical importance of a work, inter alia . Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of an artwork and its reception just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category. The descriptors necessary to this task are documented in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" Description Description This field is used to indicate a description of documented artwork ->P67i->E73[9]->has:value->Literal Description Description Type This field is used to indicate the type of description given of the documented work. ->P67i->E73[9]->P2->E55 Description Description Author This field is used to indicate the author of the description fiven of the documented work. ->P67i->E73[9]->P94i->E65[10]->p14->E39 Description Description Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the ealiest date for the creation of the description of the documented work. ->P67i->E73[9]->P94i->E65[10]->P4->E52[11]->P82a->XSD:Date Description Description Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the creation of the description of the documented work. ->P67i->E73[9]->P94i->E65[10]->p4->E52[11]->P82b->XSD:Date These descriptors should be deployed together in order to provide full context to \u2018text blobs\u2019 by means of authorship, type of description as well as the time of articulation. Parthood Artwork may require documentation not just as a whole, but with regards to its parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" n/a Parts This field is used to indicate parts of the documented artwork. ->P46->E22 n/a Part Types This field is used to indicate part types for the documented artwork. ->P46->E22->P2->E55 n/a Part Count This field is use to indicate part counts for the documented part types. ->P57->rdf:literal^^Integer Existence Of essential import in identifying and tracking artwork is information pertaining to its existence in time, particularly information regarding its creation and destruction. For this reason we have clustered descriptors relevant to such information in a common \u2018existence\u2019 category. These are described in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" Production Production Location This field is used to indicate the place of the creation of the documented artwork. ->P108i->E12[12]->P4->E53 Production Production Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the creation of the documented artwork. ->P108i->E12[12]->p4->E52[13]->P82a->XSD:Date Production Production Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the creation of the documented artwork. ->P108i->E12[12]->p4->E52[13]->P82b->XSD:Date Destruction Destruction Location This field is used to indicate the place of the destruction of the documented artwork. ->P13i->E6[14]->P7->E53 Destruction Destruction Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the destruction of the documented artwork. ->P13i->E6[14]->p4->E52[15]->P82a->XSD:Date Destruction Destruction Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the destruction of the documented artwork. ->P13i->E6[14]->p4->E52[15]->P82b->XSD:Date n/a Period This field is used to indicate the historical period in which the creation of the documented artwork occured. ->P108i->E12[16]->P10->E4 The above structure allows for the documentation of time and place of the creation and destruction of an individual artwork. Note that while ontologically speaking the agency of the creator and destroyer in the events of creation and destruction could be documented as part of this information unit, we have instead clustered this data in the Actors Relations category. Actor Relations The connection between artwork and actors provides another important set of descriptors for identifying and tracing an artwork. Particularly, basic interest clusters around the individuals involved in the creation of the artwork and those who own and/or hold the artwork presently. The actor relations information gathers these together. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" n/a Creator This field is used to indicate the artist or creator of the documented artwork. ->P108i->E12[16]->P14->E39 n/a Creator Role This field is used to indicate the role played by the artist or creator in the creation of the documented artwork. ->P108i->E12[16]->P14->P14.1->E55 n/a Current Owner This field is used to indicate the present owner of the documented artwork. ->P52->E39 n/a Current Holder This field is used to indicate the current holder of the documented artwork. ->P49->E39 n/a Material This field is used to indicate the material of which the document artwork consists. ->P45->E57 n/a Technique This field is used to indicate the technique used in the production of the documented artwork. ->P108i->E12[16]->P32->E55 These descriptors allow the connection of an artwork to its creator, present owner and holder. Substance The analysis and understanding of an artwork depends also on our knowledge of its materiality and physical characteristics. The category of substance brings together descriptors which are relevant to this form of analysis. Particularly, it groups information having to do with the composition and measurable aspects of the artwork as object. Information regarding the decomposition of the artwork into parts is found in the parthood category. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" n/a Material This field is used to indicate the material of which the documented instance of built work consists. ->P45->E57 n/a Technique This field is used to indicate the technique used in the construction of the documented instance of built work. ->P108i->E12->P32->E55 ->P108i->E12->P2->E55\"Construction\" Dimension Dimension Type This field is used to indicate the type of measurement that the dimension of the documented instance of built work is. ->P39i->E16->P40->E54->P2->E55 Dimension Dimension Value This field is used to indicate the value of the measurement of the documented instance of built work. ->P39i->E16->P40->E54->P90->XSD^^Integer Dimension Dimension Unit This field is used to indicate the unit used to express the value of the measurement of the documented instance of built work. ->P39i->E16->P40->E54->P91->E58 Dimension Dimension Taker This field is used to indicate the actor who undertook the measurement of the documented instance of built work. ->P39i->E16->P40->E54->P14->E39 Representation This information category at present is lightly populated, but provides the means to gather information relevant to the documentation of what has been documented as represented in an artwork. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" n/a Subject This field is used to indicate the subject of representation of the documented artwork. It is meant to capture general subject areas, not particular individual items represented. ->P62->E1 Events This information category brings together typical events in which an artwork may have been involved through the course of its history. It is meant to cover information concerning the most salient events documented with regards to artworks. At present this enables the documentation of ownership periods and conservation events. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22->P2->E55\"Artwork\" Provenance Past Ownership Period Statement - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for an ownership period of the documented artwork. ->P24i->E8[19]->P4->E52[20]->P82a->XSD:Date Provenance Past Ownership Period Statement - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for an ownership period of the documented artwork. ->P24i->E8[19]->P4->E52[20]->P82b->XSD:Date Provenance Past Ownership Period Statement - Owner This field is used to indicate the actor holding ownership over the documented artwork during an ownership period. ->P24i->E8[19]->P22->E39 Provenance Past Ownership Description This field used to provide a free text description related to an ownership period for the documented artwork. ->P24i->E8[19]->P70i->E31->rdf:value->BLOB Conservation Conservation Event - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for a conservation event performed on the documented artwork. ->P31i->E11[20]->P4->E52[21]->P82a->XSD:Date Conservation Conservation Event - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for a conservation event performed on the documented artwork. ->P31i->E11[20]->P4->E52[21]->P82b->XSD:Date Conservation Conservation Event - Type This field is used to indicate the type of conservation event performed on the documented artwork. ->P31i->E11[20]->E55 Conservation Conservation Event - technique This field is used to indicate the technique used in the conservation event performed on the documented artwork. ->P31i->E11[21]->P32->E55 Conservation Conservator This field is used to indicate the actor the carried out the conservation event performed on the documented artwork. ->P31i->E11[21]->P14->E21 Conservation Conservation Event Description This field used to provide a free text description related to the conservation event performed on the documented artwork. ->P31i->E11[21]->P70i->E31[22] ->P31i->E11[21]->P70i->E31[22]->P2->E55\"Description\" Location The documentation of location aids in tracking individual artworks as well as in understanding their dispersion geographically. This information category gathers together relevant descriptors for this task.

The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This information category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a person, both at present and historically. 2 Existence This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the birth and death of a person. 3 Social Relations This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the social relations of a person to other people and actors. 4 Knowledge This information category gathers together descriptors used for documenting the knowledge known to be had by a person. 5 Activities This information category gathers together descriptors used for documenting different activities that a person is known to have been involved in or with. 6 Documentation This information category gathers together different documentary descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a person. Formalisation and instructions Each individual information category is represented here both in the form of table and in the form of a semantic graph model. The graph presents an overview of the semantic model formed by the suggested descriptors, while the table provides for each individual descriptor, both an explanatory description of its intended function and a mapping of this intended function to a CIDOC-CRM path expression. The mappings present in the table, for readability purpose, use only the class and property identifiers of CIDOC-CRM adopting the formalism of: Classes: E+ID Properties: P+ID Moreover, when it is necessary to make explicit that the same node is referenced across descriptors in a semantic path variable [ n ] (where n is a number) is placed next to a class to indicate its reuse across mapping constructs. For example, the descriptor \u2018identifier\u2019 for an instance of person is mapped as: E21 - P1 - E42 [1] The descriptor for the provider of this identifier, \u2018Identifier Provider\u2019 refers back semantically to the \u2018Identifier\u2019 descriptor (qua appellation), hence in the semantic mapping the particular individual node is referred back to as the subject of the act of being given as appellation. Expressed in our formalism this becomes: E21 - P1 - E42 [1] - P37 i- E15 - P14 - E39 The variable [1] in the second mapping is provided to signal to the reader that the same node (instance of class E42) is being referred to across two mappings, the first of the identifier as such and the second of its being attributed by some organization. The classes and properties used in this document belong to the following namespaces using the following prefixes: rdf: http:// www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# rdfs: http:// www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema# crm: http:// http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/ sari: http:// w3id.org/sari# The legend for the graphs used in the document can be find at the address http://docs.swissartresearch.net/graphical/index.html . Below a graphical summary of its components. Names and Classifications The attribution of names and types to persons is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating which person is referred to in historical texts is understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to an individual at different moments. Likewise, additional classifiers of the individual as such, such as gender, help in the disambiguation, in an information system, of the reference to one real world individual from another.

Existence Of essential importance in identifying and tracking individuals is also their biographical information, such as their birth and death. For this reason we have clustered descriptors relevant to such information into a common \u2018existence\u2019 category. These are described in the table below.

Note that while ontologically speaking mothers and fathers could be connected to birth information, with regards to information clustering we have placed this information in the social relations category. Social Relations A large area of documentation and potential disambiguation around the person relates to social relations, whether they are familial, interpersonal or institutional. The social relations information category brings together descriptors for these relations into a larger group, covering relations starting from the maternal, moving to the most general membership in national and cultural blocks and assorted interpersonal connections.

The graph presents an overview of the semantic model formed by the suggested descriptors, while the table provides for each individual descriptor, both an explanatory description of its intended function and a mapping of this intended function to a CIDOC-CRM path expression. The mappings present in the table, for readability purpose, use only the class and property identifiers of CIDOC-CRM adopting the formalism of: Classes: E+ID Properties: P+ID Moreover, when it is necessary to make explicit that the same node is referenced across descriptors in a semantic path variable [ n ] (where n is a number) is placed next to a class to indicate its reuse across mapping constructs. For example, the descriptor \u2018identifier\u2019 for an instance of person is mapped as: E21 - P1 - E42 [1] The descriptor for the provider of this identifier, \u2018Identifier Provider\u2019 refers back semantically to the \u2018Identifier\u2019 descriptor (qua appellation), hence in the semantic mapping the particular individual node is referred back to as the subject of the act of being given as appellation. Expressed in our formalism this becomes: E21 - P1 - E42 [1] - P37 i- E15 - P14 - E39 The variable [1] in the second mapping is provided to signal to the reader that the same node (instance of class E42) is being referred to across two mappings, the first of the identifier as such and the second of its being attributed by some organization.

Type The class E55 Type denote concepts (not names, for those see Appellation ), preferably from a controlled source, used to classify a thing. The modelling of a Type is a pretty straightforward one: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P2 has type \u2192 E55 Type The string of characters used in the type is modelled as: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P2 has type \u2192 E55 Type \u2192 rdfs:Label \u2192 rdfs:Literal In the example below we used a term from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus to classify the object \"work/7761\" as a type of painting paintings (visual works) in AAT . Codebox 1 . Type . Click here to comment the modelling. Appellation An appellation is a sign, usually in the form of a string of characters, used for referencing an entity (e.g. a person, an object, a place, en event). More appellations can refer, in the same language, to the same entity, and can also be tied to a specific time interval. A simple appellation can be modelled in CRM as E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E41 Appellation While the string of characters used in the appellation is modelled as: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E41 Appellation \u2192 rdfs:Label \u2192 rdfs:Literal A type, preferably from a controlled vocabulary, can be used to define the diverse appellations which we assign to an entity. E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E41 Appellation \u2192 P2 has type \u2192 E55 Type In our case we chose to use the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus which can provide us with diverse qualifiers. An example is in the Codebox 1, where we modelled a person surname, name and full name using the URI of the thesaurus as E55 Type. While in the example we used the entity E21 Person, the same pattern can be used across all the entities expressed in CIDOC-CRM. Codebox 2 . Appellation . Click here to comment the modelling. The exact same pattern can be used to model preferred and not-preferred names. As before, the use of a controlled vocabulary like the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (see the preferred and not-preferred terms) would help us normalise this field. Identifier An identifier is a string assigned to an entity that uniquely identifies it in a system (usually, a digital system). Being a subclass of E41 Appellation, the modelling of the identifier in CRM is quite similar: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E42 Identifier While the string of characters used in the identifier is modelled as: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E42 Identifier \u2192 rdfs:Label \u2192 rdfs:Literal As seen in the Appellation a E55 Type, preferably from a controlled vocabulary, can be used to define the diverse appellations. We will not repeat the modelling here because it would be redundant. In the example below we used the entity E21 Person, but the same pattern can be used across all the entities expressed in CIDOC-CRM. Codebox 3 . Identifier . Click here to comment the modelling. Roles The type of agency within an activity is an ontologically complicated matter and its representations within the RDF version of CIDOC-CRM has been a long object of debate in the past. The problem lies on the fact that CIDOC-CRM use the \".1\" property to qualify the type of agency in a relationship (see Figure 1 below). While this approach would flawlessly work in a property graph, or in other Knowledge Representation Systems, it does not translate entirely well in RDF ( for more information see the debate on reification ). Figure 1. Property Graph . In order to resolve the issue the RDF version of CIDOC-CRM uses an n-ary relationship , therefore, representing the relationship as a class rather than a property, and then assign to this class an E55 Type. It is easier than it seems. Figure 2 below show a graphical representation of what we mean Figure 2. N-Ary relationship . This make easier to clarify the the type of agency within an activity. In order to demonstrate the modelling we will use one of example of \".1\" property, \"P14.1 carried out\", but their modelling is substantially the same (it changes of course the type of properties that can be used). PC14 Carried Out By \u2192 P02 has range \u2192 E21 Person PC14 Carried Out By \u2192 P01 has domain \u2192 E7 Activity PC14 Carried Out By \u2192 P14.1 in the role of \u2192 E55 Type We heavily used this construct to define the curation activities, as in the codebox below Codebox 4.

As it can be seen in the Codebox above, we used the PC property which are not expressed in the RDF version of CIDOC-CRM, but they require an extension called \"CRM-PC\" available in the resource page of the official website . Notes Notes are one of the most widespread and essential part of a KOS. Their modelling could be very easy, with a simple: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P3 has note \u2192 rdfs:literal However, sometimes it is important to make explicit the type of note we are referring too. In order to do so, we would have again to use the n-ary relationship construct ( see roles above ) with the CRM-PC extension. In this case the modelling would be PC3_has_note \u2192 crm:P3.1_has_type \u2192 E55 Type PC3_has_note \u2192 crm:P03_has_range_literal \u2192 rdfs:Literal We used this construct to qualify diverse notes which had to be interpreted differently by the machine, therefore the example below here is a bit cryptic, but still quite explicative.

In this case the modelling would be PC3_has_note \u2192 crm:P3.1_has_type \u2192 E55 Type PC3_has_note \u2192 crm:P03_has_range_literal \u2192 rdfs:Literal We used this construct to qualify diverse notes which had to be interpreted differently by the machine, therefore the example below here is a bit cryptic, but still quite explicative.

All the prefix used within the document can be found on http://prefix.cc/ . Creation of an artefact We model the physical creation of artefacts, such as paintings or photos, using the class E12 Production, a subclass of Event which described a specific activity which result in the creation of one or more new physical object. This type of creation is modelled in CRM using the E12 Production Entity, using the pattern: E22 Man-Made Object \u2192 P108 was produced by \u2192 E12 Production Technique used A production itself can be contextualised using diverse properties that augment the information about this activity.A quite important one for us was the technique used.

An example related to the production event would be the following Codebox 2. Production: agent role . Click here to comment the modelling. Exhibition We model temporary exhibitions as activities, because of their existence in time. Moving exhibitions, which do keep their collection but change location/museum are also modelled as a bigger activity (the whole exhibit), which are composed by sub-activities which do they take place in diverse locations. The modelling using CIDOC-CRM is quite simple: E7 Activity \u2192 P9 consist of \u2192 E7 Activity For a better understanding in the codebox below it is possible to see how an exhibition has been modelled as composed by two different one, each of them happening at a different time and place.

Provenance of an object We model the provenance of an object as a series of acquisition events, which transfer object from person to person. This allow us to follow the object throughout the years. This solution it is not perfect, because in an open world it does not imply that the object stay with the same owner between acquisition events (despite the fact that we do know about it).
