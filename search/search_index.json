Artwork is taken here in the sense of a movable, physical work of some sort such as would be typically inventoried by a museum. Specific documentation of elements of an artwork depend highly upon the kind of artwork it is. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an artwork and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project. These were: Acronym Source Name Official Access Point Schema Documentation Maintained by CDWA Categories for the Description of Works of Art http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/definitions.html Getty DC Dublinc Core http://dublincore.org/ http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ ASIS&T CCO Cataloging Cultural Objects http://cco.vrafoundation.org/index.php/ http://cco.vrafoundation.org/index.php/toolkit/cco_pdf_version/ CCO Commons VRA Core Visual Resources Association core categories http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/VRA_Core4_Element_Description.pdf Visual Resources Association Model Sections Description \u00b6 The fields used to describe an artwork can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category. The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to an artwork, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a work by known authors/sources. 3 Part/Whole This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between an artwork and its parts. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the creation and destruction of an artwork. 5 Actor Relations This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant relations between the artwork and known actors. Primary of such relations are those of creator to the work. 6 Substance This category gathers together descriptors used for stating the physical constitutional features of the documented artwork. 7 Representation This category gathers together descriptors regarding the representational level recognised to be present in the documented artwork. 8 Events This category gathers together information about significant documented events that an artwork may go through. 9 Location This category gathers together information regarding the present location of a documented artwork. 10 Rights This category gathers together information regarding the rights claims on a documented artwork. 11 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to an artwork. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to artwork, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating artworks lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Likewise, additional classifiers of the artwork, such as how it is has been classified as an object as such, give important distinguishing characteristics. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Artwork\" ID Attribution Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented instance of artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1] ID Attribution Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented person. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Identifier Type\" ID Attribution Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the institution providing the artwork it's ID. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15 \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 n/a Title This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41 n/a Type This field is used to indicate the formal type of object an artwork is. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[3] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[3] \u2192 P71 \u2192 E32 Alternate Title Alternative Title This field is used to indicate additional names under which the documented artwork is known. This can be linked to the additional name type and earliest and latest date of use of that name. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] Alternate Title Alternate Title Type This field is used to indicate the type of alternate name that is attributed to the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 Alternate Title Alternate Title Use Period - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest known date for use of this name for the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] \u2192 R64i \u2192 F52[5] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[6] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Alternate Title Alternate Title Use Period - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest known date for use of this name for the documented artwork. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] \u2192 R64i \u2192 F52[5] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[6] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime n/a Alternative Title - Used by This field is used to indicate the actor by whom the title attributed to the artwork is/was used. \u2192 R63i \u2192 F52[5] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 n/a Style - Movement This field is used to associate the documented artwork to a group of actors that collectively form an artistic movement. \u2192 P140i \u2192 E13[8] \u2192 P141 \u2192 E74 \u2192 P140i \u2192 E13[8] \u2192 P2 \u2192 \"P15 is influenced by\" The model provides means for tracking identifiers, present and past name use, titles and well known artwork classifiers. Description \u00b6 Artworks are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to the aesthetic and historical importance of a work, inter alia . Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of an artwork and its reception just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category. The descriptors necessary to this task are documented in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Artwork\" Description Description This field is used to indicate a description of documented artwork \u2192 P67i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 rdf:value \u2192 rdf:Literal \u2022 \u2192 P67i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56 Description Description Type This field is used to indicate the type of description given of the documented work. \u2192 P67i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 Description Description Author This field is used to indicate the author of the description fiven of the documented work. \u2192 P67i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[10] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 Description Description Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the ealiest date for the creation of the description of the documented work. \u2192 P67i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[10] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[11] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Description Description Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the creation of the description of the documented work. \u2192 P67i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65[10] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[11] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime These descriptors should be deployed together in order to provide full context to \u2018text blobs\u2019 by means of authorship, type of description as well as the time of articulation. Parthood \u00b6 Artwork may require documentation not just as a whole, but with regards to its parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Artwork\" n/a Parts This field is used to indicate parts of the documented artwork. \u2192 P46 \u2192 E22 n/a Part Types This field is used to indicate part types for the documented artwork. \u2192 P46 \u2192 E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 n/a Part Count This field is use to indicate part counts for the documented part types. \u2192 P57 \u2192 rdf:literal Existence \u00b6 Of essential import in identifying and tracking artwork is information pertaining to its existence in time, particularly information regarding its creation and destruction. For this reason we have clustered descriptors relevant to such information in a common \u2018existence\u2019 category. These are described in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Artwork\" Production Production Location This field is used to indicate the place of the creation of the documented artwork. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[12] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E53 Production Production Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the creation of the documented artwork. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[12] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[13] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Production Production Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the creation of the documented artwork. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[12] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[13] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Destruction Destruction Location This field is used to indicate the place of the destruction of the documented artwork. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[14] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53 Destruction Destruction Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the destruction of the documented artwork. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[14] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[15] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Destruction Destruction Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the destruction of the documented artwork. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[14] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[15] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime n/a Period This field is used to indicate the historical period in which the creation of the documented artwork occured. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[16] \u2192 P10 \u2192 E4 The above structure allows for the documentation of time and place of the creation and destruction of an individual artwork. Note that while ontologically speaking the agency of the creator and destroyer in the events of creation and destruction could be documented as part of this information unit, we have instead clustered this data in the Actors Relations category. Actor Relations \u00b6 The connection between artwork and actors provides another important set of descriptors for identifying and tracing an artwork. Particularly, basic interest clusters around the individuals involved in the creation of the artwork and those who own and/or hold the artwork presently. The actor relations information gathers these together. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Artwork\" n/a Creator This field is used to indicate the artist or creator of the documented artwork. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[16] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 n/a Creator Role This field is used to indicate the role played by the artist or creator in the creation of the documented artwork. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[16] \u2192 P14 \u2192 P14.1 \u2192 E55 n/a Current Owner This field is used to indicate the present owner of the documented artwork. \u2192 P52 \u2192 E39 n/a Current Holder This field is used to indicate the current holder of the documented artwork. \u2192 P49 \u2192 E39 n/a Material This field is used to indicate the material of which the document artwork consists. \u2192 P45 \u2192 E57 n/a Technique This field is used to indicate the technique used in the production of the documented artwork. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[16] \u2192 P32 \u2192 E55 These descriptors allow the connection of an artwork to its creator, present owner and holder. Substance \u00b6 The analysis and understanding of an artwork depends also on our knowledge of its materiality and physical characteristics. The category of substance brings together descriptors which are relevant to this form of analysis. Particularly, it groups information having to do with the composition and measurable aspects of the artwork as object. Information regarding the decomposition of the artwork into parts is found in the parthood category. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Artwork\" n/a Material This field is used to indicate the material of which the documented instance of built work consists. \u2192 P45 \u2192 E57 n/a Technique This field is used to indicate the technique used in the construction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12 \u2192 P32 \u2192 E55 \u2022 \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Construction\" Dimension Dimension Type This field is used to indicate the type of measurement that the dimension of the documented instance of built work is. \u2192 P39i \u2192 E16 \u2192 P40 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 Dimension Dimension Value This field is used to indicate the value of the measurement of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P39i \u2192 E16 \u2192 P40 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P90 \u2192 xsd:decimal Dimension Dimension Unit This field is used to indicate the unit used to express the value of the measurement of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P39i \u2192 E16 \u2192 P40 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P91 \u2192 E58 Dimension Dimension Taker This field is used to indicate the actor who undertook the measurement of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P39i \u2192 E16 \u2192 P40 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 Representation \u00b6 This information category at present is lightly populated, but provides the means to gather information relevant to the documentation of what has been documented as represented in an artwork. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Artwork\" n/a Subject This field is used to indicate the subject of representation of the documented artwork.

Artwork is taken here in the sense of a movable, physical work of some sort such as would be typically inventoried by a museum. Specific documentation of elements of an artwork depend highly upon the kind of artwork it is. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an artwork and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"et/artwork/#sources","text":"The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project.

Built work is taken here in the sense of a - typically - immovable building, or significant individual part thereof, made for some human use-function such as habitation. The fuller documentation of a built work would establish the relation of the physical work to the series of intellectual and social processes related to the production of such works, such as architectural plans, meetings, construction episodes, detailed use and modification history, specific topological relations and so on. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a more general level, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly used descriptors for a built work and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. Sources \u00b6 The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project.

The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a built work, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of a built work by known authors/sources. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between a built work and its parts. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the construction and destruction of a built work. 5 Actor Relations This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant relations between the built work and known actors. Primary of such relations are those of the architect and builders of the built work. 6 Substance This category gathers together descriptors used for stating the physical constitutional features of the documented built work. 7 Events This category gathers together information about significant documented events that a built work typically may go through in the course of it existence. 8 Location This category gathers together information regarding the present location of a documented built work. 9 Designation Status This category gathers together information regarding the designated statuses assigned to a built work. 10 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a built work. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to built work, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating built works lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Likewise, additional classifiers of the built work, such as how it is has been formally classified, give important distinguishing characteristics.

Description \u00b6 Built works are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to the aesthetic and historical importance of the work, inter alia . Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of a built work just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category. The descriptors necessary to this task are documented in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Built Work\" Description Description This field is used to indicate a description of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 rdf:value \u2192 rdf:literal \u2022 \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Description\" \u2022 \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56 Description Description Type This field is used to indicate the type of description given of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 Description Description Author This field is used to indicate the author of the description given of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65 \u2192 p14 \u2192 E39 Description Description Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the creation of the description of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65 \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime Description Description Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the creation of the description of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65 \u2192 p4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime These descriptors should be deployed together in order to provide full context to \u2018text blobs\u2019 by means of authorship, type of description as well as the time of articulation. Parthood \u00b6 Built works may require documentation not just as a whole, but with regards to their parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. The parthood relations of built works are both highly important information in understanding of this type of work and also highly complex to document. In this base model, we represent simply the relation of belonging of one Built Work to another. An extended model would take account of mereological and topological relations in a much richer way. At the basic reference level, however, this level of detail is not necessary. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Built Work\" n/a Parts This field is used to indicate parts of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P46 \u2192 E22 Existence \u00b6 Of essential importance in identifying and tracking built works is information pertaining to their existence, particularly regarding their construction and destruction dates. For this reason we have clustered descriptors relevant to such information in a common \u2018existence\u2019 category. These are described in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E22 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Built Work\" Production Construction Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the construction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[111] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime \u2022 \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Construction\" Production Construction Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the construction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[111] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime \u2022 \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Construction\" Production Production Place This field is used to indicate the place of the construction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53 \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Construction\" Destruction Destruction Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest date for the destruction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[11] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[112] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime Destruction Destruction Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest date for the destruction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[11] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[112] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime Destruction Destruction place This field is used to indicate the place of the destruction of the documented instance of built work. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[11] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53 n/a Destruction period This field is used to indicate the historical period in which the destruction of the documented instance of built work occured. \u2192 P13i \u2192 E6[11] \u2192 P10 \u2192 E4 n/a Construction period This field is used to indicate the historical period in which the construction of the documented instance of built work occured. \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P10 \u2192 E4 \u2022 \u2192 P108i \u2192 E12[10] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 \"Construction\" The above structure allows for the documentation of time of construction and destruction of a built work as a whole. Note that while ontologically speaking the agency of the architect and builder in the events of construction could be documented as part of this information unit, we have instead clustered this data in the actors Relations category. Actor Relations \u00b6 The connection between a built work and actors provides another important set of descriptors for identifying and tracing it. Particularly, basic interest clusters around the individuals involved in the creation of the built work and those who own the built work presently. The actor relations information gathers these together.

Substance \u00b6 The analysis and understanding of a built work depends also on our knowledge of its materiality and physical characteristics. The category of substance brings together descriptors which are relevant to this form of analysis. Particularly, it groups information having to do with the composition and measurable aspects of the built work as object. Information regarding the decomposition of the built work into parts is found in the parthood category.

Built work is taken here in the sense of a - typically - immovable building, or significant individual part thereof, made for some human use-function such as habitation. The fuller documentation of a built work would establish the relation of the physical work to the series of intellectual and social processes related to the production of such works, such as architectural plans, meetings, construction episodes, detailed use and modification history, specific topological relations and so on. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a more general level, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly used descriptors for a built work and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.","title":"Built Work Reference Data Model"},{"location":"et/built_work/#sources","text":"The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project.

Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. \u00b6 Sources The minimal metadata set for digital object was abstracted from typical use scenarios in CMS systems related to cultural heritage.

Examples of events would be workshops, meetings, conferences, congresses and so on. The aim of this reference model is to cover basic descriptors that are typically employed in the documentation of an event. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an event as such and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression. \u00b6 Sources Documented schema for structuring events data, in the sense of planned occasions, documented historically are not generally available or in use, despite the fact that such data is regularly collected in bespoke systems. In order to have reference schema from which to build the model, we looked at work on the more general question of periods and documentation of time along with the schema.org schema for events: Acronym Source Name Official Access Point Schema Documentation Maintained by PeriodO http://perio.do http://perio.do/technical-overview/#period-collections UNC Chronontology http://chronontology.dainst.org/ DAI Schema.org Schema.org http://schema.org Schema.org The overlap of general modelling of periods with the question of events is not large. Therefore, the reference model presented was generated on the basis also of tacit knowledge with regards to fields deployed in non-open documentation schemas for documenting events. Model Sections Description \u00b6 The fields used to describe an event can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category. The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to an event, both at present and historically. 2 Description This category is used to gather together information regarding significant descriptions given of an event by known authors/sources. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the mereological relations between an event and its parts. 4 Existence This category gathers together descriptors relevant to the temporal extent of an event. 5 Participation This category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the significant entities that played a role in the event. This has to do both with tracking the participation of actors and their roles in events, but also the use of and creation of documents as the results of events, and the employment of specific tools. 6 Intention This category gathers together descriptors used for describing the goals and aims of an event. 7 Location This category gathers together information regarding where an event took place. 8 Documentation This category gathers together different descriptors that provide reference information with regards to an event. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to events, as with other entities, is a basic human activity. A chief factor in disambiguating events lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Historical events often receive different names according to the groups naming it, as well as receiving different kinds of names according to contexts (such as abbreviations and so on). Likewise, additional classifiers of the event, such as how it is has been formally categorized, give important distinguishing characteristics. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E7 Activity ID Attribution Identifier This field is used to indicate an identifier attributed to the documented event. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1] ID Attribution Identifier Type This field is used to indicate the type of an identifier attributed to the documented event. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[\"Identifier Type\"] ID Attribution Identifier Provider This field is used to indicate the institution providing the documented event it's ID. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15 \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 Identifier Attribution Identifier Source This field is used to indicate the source based on which the identifer was attributed to the object. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E42[1] \u2192 P37i \u2192 E15 \u2192 P16 \u2192 E73 Name Name This field is used to indicate the main name attributed to the documented instance of event. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[2] Name Name Language This field is used to indicate the language of the name attributed to the documented entity. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[2] \u2192 P72 \u2192 E56 n/a Type This field is used to indicate the formal type of event a documented instance of event is classified as. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[3] \u2022 \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55[3] \u2192 P71 \u2192 E32 Alternative Name Alternative Name This field is used to indicate additional names under which the documented instance of event is known. This can be linked to the additional name type and earliest and latest date of use of that name. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] Alternative Name Alternate Name Type This field is used to indicate the type of alternate name that is attributed to the documented instance of event. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 Alternative Name Alternate Name Use Period - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest known date for use of an alternate name for the documented instance of event. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] \u2192 R64i \u2192 F52[5] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[6] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Alternative Name Alternate Name Use Period - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest known date for use of an alternate name for the documented instance of event. \u2192 P1 \u2192 E41[4] \u2192 R64i \u2192 F52[5] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[6] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Alternative Name Alternative Name - Used by This field is used to indicate the actor by whom the alternate name attributed to the instance of event is/was used. \u2192 R63i \u2192 F52[5] \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 n/a Type This field is used to indicate the type of event that occurred. \u2192 P2 \u2192 E55 The model provides means for tracking identifiers, present and past name use, names and well known typological attributions of the event. Description \u00b6 Events are the subjects of innumerable descriptions that provide a wide range of information with regards to what took place during the event and how, as well as providing interpretations of its significance and import. Such descriptions are of use in a scholarly understanding of an event just in case we are able to track the provenance of such elocutions in a systematic fashion. Such an aim drives the need for the tracking of description information as a separate category. The descriptors necessary to this task are documented in the table below.

Parthood \u00b6 Events are a typical case of the kind of entity whose accurate documentation may require the breaking down of the event into parts and sub-parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. The parthood relations of events help contextualize the meaning of events, as well as to be able to pick out the exact composition of a complex event by breaking it down into smaller subunits (e.g. A conference may break down into sessions and sessions into talks). In this base model, we represent simply the relation of belonging of one event to another. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E7 Activity n/a Part of This field is used to indicate that the broader period that the documented event falls within. \u2192 P10i \u2192 E5 n/a Has Part This field is used to indicate individually documented sub events which form part of the documented event. \u2192 P10 \u2192 E5 Existence \u00b6 The existence of an event must be determined by documentary or physical evidence of the past. The documentation of the existence of an event, however, essentially relates to ascribing that event dates, where possible, durations otherwise, and a description of the temporality where none of the above is possible. The descriptors and mappings for these potentialities are documented in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E7 Activity Start Motivating Event This field is used to relate an event to a preceding event which was undertaken in preparation of the documented event. \u2192 P20i \u2192 E5 Start Earliest Possible Start Date This field is used to indicate the earliest possible start date for the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTime Start Latest Possible Start Date This field is used to indicate the latest possible date for the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P81a \u2192 xsd:dateTime End Earliest Possible End Date This field is used to indicate the earliest possible date for the end of a documented instance of event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P81b \u2192 xsd:dateTime End Latest Possible End Date This field is used to indicate the latest date for the destruction of the documented instance of event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTime Duration Maximal Duration - Value This field is used to indicate the time value of the maximal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P84 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P90 \u2192 xsd:dateTime Duration Maximal Duration - Unit This field is used to indicate the unit of the time value of the maximal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P84 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P91 \u2192 E58 Duration Minimal Duration - Value This field is used to indicate the time value of the minimal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P83 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P90 \u2192 xsd:dateTime Duration Minimal Duration - Unit This field is used to indicate the unit of the time value of the minimal known duration of the event. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P83 \u2192 E54 \u2192 P91 \u2192 E58 Description Time Description This field is used to provide the possibility of a free text description of the time span of the documented event itself. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 rdf:value \u2192 rdf:Literal Description Time Description Author This field is used to provide the author the free text description of the time span of the documented event itself. \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52 \u2192 P129i \u2192 E73[9] \u2192 P94i \u2192 E65 \u2192 p14 \u2192 E39 The above structure allows for the documentation of the begin and end of an event, when known, its duration, as well as linking to motivating events (for example a preparatory meeting), and the plain text description of the temporality of an event. Participation \u00b6 The use of documenting events in historical study comes especially in tracing the interaction of actors, ideas and things in time and the evolution of the connections that are created between them. Events are nexuses in which actors, ideas and things participate. They can also be the junction for the creation of new ideas. The descriptors gathered here focus on the typical participants to events in the sense of planned social occasions, especially in a formal context. Therefore they focus on agents and their roles, documents and document production, as well as the use of particular implements (e.g. famous pens) in the carrying out of events. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E7 Activity n/a Actor This field is used to indicate actors involved in the documented instance of event. \u2192 P14 \u2192 E39 n/a Actor Role This field is used to indicate the role played by the actors involved in the documented instance of event. \u2192 P14 \u2192 P14.1 \u2192 E55 n/a Objects Employed This field is used to indicate objects known to have played a role in the documented event. \u2192 P16 \u2192 E18 n/a Documents Employed This field is used to indicate information objects that are known to have been used during the event. Information objects created during the event can be referenced here.

Intention \u00b6 Events, as planned social occasions and interactions, usually take place with a particular intention in mind. In the case of formal events, such intentions are usually formalized as lists of topics. The description of the reasons motivating an event are important in its analysis. In this information category we gather together descriptors for documenting this data.

The intention of this reference model is to provide a consolidated, high-level formal structure comprising the most commonly reused descriptors for a group and, further, to provide for these a set of semantic mapping to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked in respect to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns to be adopted by groups acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.

The information categories identified have been enumerated in the following table. # Name Function 1 Names and Classifications This information category gathers together descriptors used for assigning names and types to a group, both at present and historically. 2 Existence This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to the tracking of the formation and dissolution of a group. 3 Parthood This category is used to bring together information relevant to the composition of a group with relation to its parts and its belonging to wider groups. 4 Actor Relations This information category gathers together descriptors relevant to tracking the relations held between a group and other people or actors. 5 Activities This information category gathers together descriptors used for documenting different activities that a group is known to have been involved in or with. 6 Location This category gathers together information regarding the seat of a group. 7 Documentation This information category gathers together different documentary descriptors that provide reference information with regards to a group. Names and Classifications \u00b6 The attribution of names and types to things, including groups, is a basic human activity. The disambiguation of groups is aided by the understanding of the various names and identifiers that have been given to a group at different moments in time. Moreover, classifications such as group type and legal status can help in identifying and studying groups over time.

Existence \u00b6 Of essential importance in identifying and tracking groups is to know when they came into existence and if they have gone out of existence. For this reason we have clustered descriptors relevant to such information into a common \u2018existence\u2019 category. These are described in the table below. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E74 Group Formation Place of Formation This field is used to indicate the place of formation of the documented group. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[7] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53 Formation Formation Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest known date for the formation of the documented group. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[7] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[8] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime Formation Formation Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest known date for the formation of the documented group. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[7] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[8] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime Formation Formed from This field is used to associate a group which pre-existed the document group and from which it was formed. \u2192 P95i \u2192 E66[7] \u2192 P151 \u2192 E74 Dissolution Place of Dissolution This field is used to indicate the place of dissolution of the documented group. \u2192 P99i \u2192 E68[9] \u2192 P7 \u2192 E53 Dissolution Dissolution Date - Earliest This field is used to indicate the earliest known date for the dissolution of the documented group. \u2192 P99i \u2192 E68[9] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[10] \u2192 P82a \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime Dissolution Dissolution Date - Latest This field is used to indicate the latest known date for the dissolution of the documented group. \u2192 P99i \u2192 E68[9] \u2192 P4 \u2192 E52[10] \u2192 P82b \u2192 xsd:dateTimeTime The above structure allows for the documentation of time and place of formation and dissolution of a group. Note that while ontologically speaking founding members are connected to the formation information, with regards to information clustering here we have placed this information in the actor relations category. Parthood \u00b6 Groups often exist in complex internal structuration with both relations of subsumption towards sub-parts of the group and of belonging with regards to larger groups. This is a particular form of social parthood between groups. Groups, therefore, may require documentation not just as a whole, but with regards to their parts. This information category gathers together the basic descriptors typically deployed to this end. Element Field Collection Element name Element Description E74 Group n/a Group Part of This field is used to indicate the membership of the documented group in a larger formation. The referenced entity should be a group. \u2192 P107i \u2192 E74 n/a Has Part This field is used to indicate members of the documented group. The referenced entity should be a group. \u2192 P107 \u2192 E74 The intention of these part whole relations is to be used between instances of groups and their parts, larger or smaller. In particular, we have in mind the relationships of proper belonging, where a department belongs to a faculty which in turn belongs to a university. For describing the more general relations of parthood, like the groups belonging to a nation, or more particular relations, like those between actors and the group, please see the actor relations information category. Actor Relations \u00b6 A useful area of documentation and potential disambiguation around a group concerns its relations to other actors in the world. The actor relations information category brings together descriptors for these relations into a larger group, covering relations concerning national affiliation, membership and employment with a group.

The modelling of such type of statements are going to be described in this section. The modelling choices are recorded as generalisable patterns. Each pattern is made explicit using an example which it is both encoded in RDF using Turtle and presented, below each codebox, in a graphical form. All the prefix used within the document can be found on http://prefix.cc/ . Type \u00b6 The class E55 Type denote concepts (not names, for those see Appellation ), preferably from a controlled source, used to classify a thing. The modelling of a Type is a pretty straightforward one: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P2 has type \u2192 E55 Type The string of characters used in the type is modelled as: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P2 has type \u2192 E55 Type \u2192 rdfs:Label \u2192 rdfs:Literal In the example below we used a term from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus to classify the object \"work/7761\" as a type of painting paintings (visual works) in AAT .

Appellation \u00b6 An appellation is a sign, usually in the form of a string of characters, used for referencing an entity (e.g. a person, an object, a place, en event). More appellations can refer, in the same language, to the same entity, and can also be tied to a specific time interval. A simple appellation can be modelled in CRM as E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E41 Appellation While the string of characters used in the appellation is modelled as: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E41 Appellation \u2192 rdfs:Label \u2192 rdfs:Literal A type, preferably from a controlled vocabulary, can be used to define the diverse appellations which we assign to an entity. E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E41 Appellation \u2192 P2 has type \u2192 E55 Type In our case we chose to use the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus which can provide us with diverse qualifiers. An example is in the Codebox 1, where we modelled a person surname, name and full name using the URI of the thesaurus as E55 Type. While in the example we used the entity E21 Person, the same pattern can be used across all the entities expressed in CIDOC-CRM. Codebox 2 . Appellation . Click here to comment the modelling. The exact same pattern can be used to model preferred and not-preferred names. As before, the use of a controlled vocabulary like the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (see the preferred and not-preferred terms) would help us normalise this field. Identifier \u00b6 An identifier is a string assigned to an entity that uniquely identifies it in a system (usually, a digital system). Being a subclass of E41 Appellation, the modelling of the identifier in CRM is quite similar: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E42 Identifier While the string of characters used in the identifier is modelled as: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P1 is identified by \u2192 E42 Identifier \u2192 rdfs:Label \u2192 rdfs:Literal As seen in the Appellation a E55 Type, preferably from a controlled vocabulary, can be used to define the diverse appellations. We will not repeat the modelling here because it would be redundant. In the example below we used the entity E21 Person, but the same pattern can be used across all the entities expressed in CIDOC-CRM. Codebox 3 . Identifier . Click here to comment the modelling. Roles \u00b6 The type of agency within an activity is an ontologically complicated matter and its representations within the RDF version of CIDOC-CRM has been a long object of debate in the past. The problem lies on the fact that CIDOC-CRM use the \".1\" property to qualify the type of agency in a relationship (see Figure 1 below). While this approach would flawlessly work in a property graph, or in other Knowledge Representation Systems, it does not translate entirely well in RDF ( for more information see the debate on reification ). Figure 1. Property Graph . In order to resolve the issue the RDF version of CIDOC-CRM uses an n-ary relationship , therefore, representing the relationship as a class rather than a property, and then assign to this class an E55 Type. It is easier than it seems. Figure 2 below show a graphical representation of what we mean Figure 2. N-Ary relationship . This make easier to clarify the the type of agency within an activity. In order to demonstrate the modelling we will use one of example of \".1\" property, \"P14.1 carried out\", but their modelling is substantially the same (it changes of course the type of properties that can be used). PC14 Carried Out By \u2192 P02 has range \u2192 E21 Person PC14 Carried Out By \u2192 P01 has domain \u2192 E7 Activity PC14 Carried Out By \u2192 P14.1 in the role of \u2192 E55 Type We heavily used this construct to define the curation activities, as in the codebox below Codebox 4.

As it can be seen in the Codebox above, we used the PC property which are not expressed in the RDF version of CIDOC-CRM, but they require an extension called \"CRM-PC\" available in the resource page of the official website . Notes \u00b6 Notes are one of the most widespread and essential part of a KOS. Their modelling could be very easy, with a simple: E1 CRM Entity \u2192 P3 has note \u2192 rdfs:literal However, sometimes it is important to make explicit the type of note we are referring too. In order to do so, we would have again to use the n-ary relationship construct ( see roles above ) with the CRM-PC extension. In this case the modelling would be PC3_has_note \u2192 crm:P3.1_has_type \u2192 E55 Type PC3_has_note \u2192 crm:P03_has_range_literal \u2192 rdfs:Literal We used this construct to qualify diverse notes which had to be interpreted differently by the machine, therefore the example below here is a bit cryptic, but still quite explicative.
