                      <p>Swiss Art Research Infrastructure, or SARI, is a national research infrastructure developed by the University of Zurich in collaboration with the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture in ETH for providing unified access to research data, digitised visual resources, and related reference data in the field of art history, design history, history of photography, architecture and other disciplines related to the visual studies, as well as the digital humanities at large. </p>

                      <p>One of the main aims of the project is to integrate different information (semantified or not), coming from various swiss institutions into a shared platform. Each dataset is not only merely taken and upload on a graph database but it is (when necessary) transformed and normalised. While, indeed, it would be possible to use diverse ontologies to describe different datasets, the project aims to integrate information and not merely create a common repository difficult to query and without any added value if not a unique point of access.</p>

      <p>In order to achieve this aim, it is necessary to use a common shared information structure, able to cover the diverse nuances of the recorded information in the visual history domain.</p>

                      <p>For such purpose, we do rely on <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org">CIDOC-CRM</a> as main reference ontology. CIDOC-CRM has been used from the very beginning of SARI and it is used to transform and normalise information structure, in order to enhance and link data together. The purpose is, of course, to integrate into a larger network of different data sources that together can help us know more about our domain. </p>

                      <p>The result is a series of CIDOC-CRM patterns for recording basic and complex information about an entity.  In order to make everything readable and browsable we aggregated these patterns by entity type as well as by purpose. For example, in the description of a Person we will be able to find a series of patterns about identification, existence and documentation, all aggregated in respect of their function. The purpose is to provide a searchable and easy to use (specifically for beginners) system.</p>

                      <p>These patterns are shared and available online to whoever wanna use them. But the effort has been used also internally. We do use it in conjunction with X3ML to map and transform not-semantic data, as well as we use them to construct information pattern in Researchspace/Metaphactory, the software architecture we use to manage our graph. Researchspace/Metaphactory allow us to create forms to modify information or add to the graph newer ones. The basic patterns we use comes from the Reference Data Models. Once the patterns are selected we transform them into forms to be used by our users. </p>

      <p>The forms used are themselves saved in GitHub, and they are going to be made available to everyone, in order that anyone who uses Researchspace/Metaphactory can choose from a library of pattern information. But that’s the (near) future.</p>

      <p>The patterns are not only used as mere tools, but they are an educational tool themselves that allow us to reason about how things are linked together and how improve their findability.</p>

                      <p>With the term “social relationships” we refer to every type of relationships which can be used to describe communities. We do not distinguish between typical subgroups such as family, but we do include those into the term “social relationships”. The context of the relationship (at birth or during the life of the recorded person) can provide more information about the type of relationship itself. The status of being cousin, for example, does change in respect to the social norms. We do not encode the norm but provide only the possibility to encode the relationships.</p>

      <p>Typical example of social relationship for SARI are the student/master relationship, or patron/client (quite commonly found in the description of the life of an artist), as well as the ward/guardian relationship.</p>

            <div class="slide-notes">
                      <p>In order to encode such relationship, we defined a class, called SRPC3 (SARI property class), which materialises an n-ary construct used to indicate the nature of the relationship that holds between the instance of E21 person defined as domain and range of SRPC3. The type of relationship that exists between the two instances of E21 Person is defined using the property SRP3 relation type, which points to a E55 Type, a vocabulary entry describing the type of relationship existing between the described persons. ie: if E55 instantiated as Father then the semantic interpretation of this is E21(a) "has father" E21(b).</p>

      <p>While the class is surely useful we need to face some shortcoming. There is clearly a lack of symmetry. This is due by the use of a n-ary construct in respect to classical properties. The alternative would have been, in fact, a list of social relationships between person, such as in many other ontologies, in the typical form of “is_cousin_of”, “is_master_of”, “is_patron_of” etc.</p>

      <p>While advantageous, this approach brings upon an infinite list of properties which need to be constantly curated to satisfy the specific case at hand. We choose to go with a n-ary construct because we deemed to be more stable over time, leaving the curatorial aspect not in the ontology but on an external vocabulary of types.</p>

                      <p>For imprecision of information we do refer to the presence of values which lack the accuracy we do think it is possible to achieve in respect to the recorded information. Imprecise information usually takes the form of interval or range, and it is quite common when describing historical information. A typical example is the recording of the birth of a person as in between 01/01/1201 and 31/01/1201. The information given does satisfy the computational component of the research, but does not satisfy the actual historical accuracy. The actual information is: we do know the year, but not the exact moment” and not, as it may seem reading this statement as “the person start to be born the 01/01/1201 and finish to be born the 31/01/1201”.  </p>

      <p>owever, as human, we do know that labour does not last a year, as well as we know that the statement “from 01/01/1201 till 31/01/1201” does actually means that we do only know the year of birth and not the day and month.</p>

                      <p>This solution presents some advantages and some disadvantages. An important advantage is its easiness to implement on top of current data structures. There are also disadvantages, such as the lack of formality and the subjectivity of the statements. The method we used does only classify nodes with respect to our knowledge about them, and it is targeted to the readers more than on the machines that will have to interpret the data. The imprecision does always refers to possible scenario which are not formalised (there cannot be a completely precise statement, but only approximation of reality). However, for the time being, the method work and we are going to work together with the semantic community in order to find a shared solution for tackling the issue.</p>

We do use language tags for the various regional forms of terms, but we do also understand the limits, specifically in respect to dialects and local variations. In order to have such information encoded we do use language tags in relation to encoded information, specifically relying on glottolog for the stable URI for languages.</p>
